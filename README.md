# MTN MoMo Data (SMS) | Analysis Dashboard
This project transforms a dense XML archive of 1,600 MTN MoMo SMS transactions ranging from airtime purchases and bill payments to money transfers into a full-stack web app that reveals patterns, activity types, and transactional flows across Rwandaâ€™s mobile money ecosystem.
Exercising full-stack proficiency; backend workflows, structured data storage, and user interface design

## The task is to:
- [x] Clean and categorize raw SMS data in an xml file
- [x] Store the data in a relational database
- [x] Build an interactive frontend dashboard to analyze the data
- [x] Develop a backend API (Flask) to fetch data from the database for the frontend.

## Tasks in Detail
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:**
  - Parse the XML using Python ml.etree.ElementTree library
  - Categorize SMS by transaction type (e.g., payments, deposits, withdrawals)
  - Normalize fields (amounts, dates, phone numbers), and
  - Log unprocessed messages.
- **Database Design:**
  - Design a relational schema (SMySQL) to store cleaned transactions with fields like ID, type, amount, parties, and timestamp.
  - Ensure data integrity, Handle duplicates, and insert via script.
- **Frontend Dashboard:**
  - Build an interactive dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS) with
  - Search, filters, and data visualizations (e.g., volume by type, monthly summaries) using libraries like Chart.js
- **Backend API:**
  - Create a REST API (Flask) to serve all, filtered, or summarized transactions.
  - Connect it to the dashboard with async requests.
